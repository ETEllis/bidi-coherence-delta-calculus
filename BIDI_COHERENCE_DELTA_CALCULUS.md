# BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus

Date: 2026-06-18

Status: public engineering specification, v0.2.2.

BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus is a native `.cdc` language with a formal
coherence-calculus kernel for hybrid systems that need continuous dynamics,
balanced-ternary commitments, delayed coupling, local invariants, nested
reference frames, and coherence-preserving operators.

## One-Line Definition

BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus is a host-independent language/kernel pair for
coupled bounded processes: phase-state cells are grouped into boundary modules,
connected by delayed weighted channels that may carry angular phase bias and
line projection, evolved continuously, and periodically committed through
event-triggered balanced-ternary invariant gates that preserve coherence and
reduce variational prediction error.

## What It Gives An Engineer

The calculus gives one compact substrate for:

- continuous-time dynamics;
- event-driven state transitions;
- delayed signal propagation;
- local learning and weight adaptation;
- predictive-coding style belief updates;
- active-inference style action updates;
- nested multi-scale systems;
- reference-frame coupling across scales;
- gated policy/invariant enforcement;
- symbolic/discrete computation through configured instruction modules;
- balanced-ternary trace/window measurement without binary observer primitives;
- a small native surface notation for declaring fields, modules, channels, flow, and commits.

The key value is not that it replaces every existing runtime. The value is that it gives a unified language for systems that are usually split across state machines, reactive runtimes, neural dynamics, simulations, control loops, and policy gates.

## Core Implementation Contract

The canonical calculus primitives are:

- cell
- channel
- module
- field
- commit
- `bidi-gamma-delta` / `bidiγΔ`

The current repository has one host artifact: `cdc_boot.py`. It is a loader and
native contract checker. It does not expose reducer classes, runtime objects, or
law logic. A conforming implementation must preserve the native `.cdc` terms,
rules, invariants, capabilities, witnesses, and expectations declared in
`kernel.cdc`, `laws.cdc`, `bridge64.cdc`, `bridge_codebooks.cdc`,
`bridge_jobs.cdc`,
`system.cdc`, `relations.cdc`, and `trace_windows.cdc`. The bridge codebook is
also consumed by the non-Python runtime `runtime/cdc_bridge_runtime.c`.

## Native Language Target

CDC's center of gravity is the `.cdc` language. The calculus is its semantic
kernel.

The intended product form is a native `.cdc` language distribution: a developer
installs a `cdc` runtime, writes `.cdc`, runs `.cdc`, tests `.cdc`, and ships
`.cdc` packages. The only temporary Python file is the bootloader; it is not part
of the desired semantic substrate.

`kernel.cdc` is the first native self-hosting contract. It declares the terms,
rules, capability surface, balanced-ternary carrier, and remaining bootloader
boundary that future passes must burn down. `bridge64.cdc` is the explicit
64-row `2^6 = 4^3` dyadic/triadic bridge codebook, and
`runtime/cdc_bridge_runtime.c` consumes it for lookup, trace-coordinate
projection, and grid generation. The end
state is not "Python runs `.cdc`"; it is "`.cdc` contains its own
parser/reducer/witness semantics, with a minimal replaceable runtime beneath it."
For this release, Python remains only as the deliberately temporary bootloader
because it is portable and inspectable; semantic authority belongs in `.cdc`
declarations and obligations.

## Canonical Term Map

| Calculus term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| phase cell | A continuous state carrier with phase, amplitude, plasticity, latched pole, and memory. |
| delayed channel | A directed weighted edge with continuous delay, angular bias, and optional line projection. |
| boundary module | A unit of phase cells with input/output cones, belief state, priors, precision, and optional child field. |
| coupled field | A graph of boundary modules evolving under continuous dynamics and evented commits. |
| commit | A guarded discrete state update that quantizes, enforces invariants, updates belief, and latches output. |
| input cone | The receiving half of a boundary module. |
| output cone | The projecting half of a boundary module. |
| boundary openness | How strongly a phase cell is allowed to exchange influence. |
| phase-order magnitude | Magnitude of mean orientation, in `[0, 1]`. |
| nonnegative balance invariant | A prefix-walk constraint that prevents negative coherence debt. |
| prediction error | Difference between received evidence and current belief/prior. |
| latent projection | A reduced internal representation distilled from middle state channels. |
| bidiγΔ | Path-aware bidirectional coherence-delta relation across nested scales; the neutral `alpha=0` case gives up/down cones. |

| measurement | A passive trace or committing guarded-commit record. |

Formal phrasing:

> The formal cross-scale operator is `bidi-gamma-delta`: bidirectional coherence-delta coupling. It carries context downward, evidence upward, angular phase difference, and coherence/error differences across nested reference frames.

## Formal Object Model

### Phase Cell

A phase cell holds:

```text
theta: phase angle
a: amplitude
p: plasticity
sigma: latched committed pole
mu: memory
omega: intrinsic angular velocity
```

Its runtime value is balanced ternary:

```text
+1 if cos(theta) > deadband
-1 if cos(theta) < -deadband
 0 otherwise
```

Its boundary openness is:

```text
kappa(theta) = max(0, 1 - abs(cos(theta)) / deadband)
```

Interpretation:

- phase gives continuous state;
- ternary value gives runtime symbolic state;
- latched pole gives persistent discrete state;
- openness controls how much influence passes through the boundary;
- plasticity controls coupling adaptation.

### Delayed Coupling Channel

A channel connects source boundary module to destination boundary module:

```text
source -> destination
weight
delay tau
angle alpha
optional projected line indexes
optional Hebbian adaptation
```

Interpretation:

- this is signal propagation with delay;
- delay is continuous, not tick-indexed;
- `angle` rotates the source into the destination reference frame;
- influence can be all-channel or projected onto selected target lines;
- endpoints may be nesting paths such as `P/c -> P`;
- optional plasticity changes channel strength from correlation.

### Boundary Module

A boundary module is a self-contained process:

```text
phase cells
input cone
output cone
belief vector
prior vector
precision
action gain
optional child field
history for delayed reads
optional instruction fields
```

Interpretation:

- input cone receives evidence;
- output cone projects state;
- belief and prior implement predictive-coding style inference;
- precision weights prediction error;
- action gain lets the module change projection to make sensed input match priors;
- child field enables nested multi-scale computation.

### Coupled Process Field

A field contains modules and coupling channels:

```text
modules: name -> boundary module
channels: delayed weighted angular/path relations
dt: integration step for realization
gain: coupling gain
deadband: ternary quantization threshold
guards: event predicates
events: off-grid commit log
```

Interpretation:

- the mathematical model is continuous-time;
- a realization approximates it numerically;
- event guards fire commits by threshold crossing, not by global clock;
- nesting gives multirate dynamics.

## Dynamics

### 1. Afferent Signal

For each destination module, incoming influence is the delayed weighted sum of source outputs, rotated by relation angle, optionally projected onto target lines, and modulated by source and destination boundary openness.

Operational meaning:

> Every boundary module reads a delayed complex-valued superposition from its neighbors. Closed boundaries reduce coupling. Open boundaries admit more exchange.

This is a useful bridge to:

- signal processing;
- coupled oscillators;
- graph neural dynamics;
- recurrent control systems;
- electromagnetic/wave interference analogies.

### 2. Continuous Flow

Between commits:

- phase turns toward incoming signal;
- amplitude relaxes;
- belief descends prediction error toward evidence and prior;
- plastic channels adapt by correlation;
- optional action dynamics alter output to reduce mismatch.

Operational meaning:

> The field behaves like a continuous recurrent dynamical system with delayed coupling, local predictive state, and optional adaptive weights.

### 3. Evented Commit

A commit fires when a guard crosses its threshold upward. The event time is interpolated off the numerical integration grid.

The commit performs:

1. move phases partly toward nearest pole;
2. enforce the nonnegative balance invariant;
3. rotate invalid negative-debt cells to the open crossing state;
4. update belief toward evidence;
5. reject the commit if free energy increases;
6. latch committed runtime poles into persistent `sigma`.

Operational meaning:

> A commit is an atomic guarded transition with invariant enforcement and free-energy rejection. It is the bridge between continuous dynamics and discrete state.

### 3.5 Trace/Window Measurement

An observer is a role held through a window, not a privileged substance:

```text
window = scope path + line projection + angle frame + horizon
trace  = phase/event history through that window
measure = passive trace or committing ternary commit record
```

Passive observation records without changing dynamics. Committing measurement
uses the existing guarded commit and returns a ternary outcome vector. The
crossing value `0` remains a real aperture state, not binary false.

Trace order is local to the window. Phase can move smoothly with zero commit
events, and two windows over one field can observe different event densities.
The calculus therefore has smooth phase-time, event-time, and trace-time without
requiring a universal tick.

A window may also carry local sampling, commit, and adaptation policy. That
policy can change what the window projects or records, but it does not add a new
observer primitive. The observer remains a role inside the same flow/commit/nest
spine.

### 4. Free Energy

Each boundary module tracks a local objective:

```text
prediction error
+ complexity / prior deviation
- orientation alignment with incoming signal
```

It is reduced by two mechanisms:

- perception: update belief toward evidence;
- action: alter projected phase so incoming evidence shifts toward prior.

Operational meaning:

> The module can reduce mismatch by changing its internal model or by changing its output into the coupled field.

### 5. Bidi-Gamma-Delta Coupling

Preserved formal concept: `bidiγΔ`, written in engineering prose as **bidirectional coherence-delta coupling**.

Definition:

- gamma (`gamma`) is coherence, the phase-order magnitude;
- delta (`delta`) is the difference between predicted/actual, parent/child, or local/global coherence;
- down-coupling sends parent context into children through an aggregate relation;
- up-coupling sends child coherence into parent evidence through an aggregate relation;
- nonzero angular phase bias rotates either direction into a different reference frame;
- the two directions together define reference-frame coupling.

Operational meaning:

> `bidi-gamma-delta` couples nested systems by sending context downward and evidence upward, while exposing the phase/coherence/error delta between scales.

This maps cleanly to:

- hierarchical predictive processing;
- multiscale control;
- message passing on nested graphs;
- coarse-graining and renormalization-style summaries;
- distributed systems with local/global state reconciliation;
- reference-frame consistency in simulation and mixed-reality systems.

## Operators

### Gate

Native operator:

```text
gate A B
```

Engineering meaning:

> Compose two boundary states by multiplying corresponding complex phase values. A module can act as an operator on another module.

Use cases:

- context-dependent transformation;
- policy gate;
- phase-conditioned routing;
- operator-as-data.

### Interfere

Native operator:

```text
interfere A B gain=1.0
```

Engineering meaning:

> Superpose two boundary states. Reinforcement or cancellation depends on phase relation.

Use cases:

- correlation;
- binding;
- conflict detection;
- coherence scoring;
- consensus formation.

### Core-Fold

Native operator:

```text
corefold A
```

Engineering meaning:

> Project a larger boundary state into a compact latent representation using internal channels.

Use cases:

- abstraction;
- summary state;
- portable hidden state;
- lower-dimensional control surface.

## Native Surface Notation

The `.cdc` notation has a compact engineering reading:

```text
deadband <real>
field <name> dt=<real> gain=<real>
module <name> theta <theta1..theta6>
module <name> trits <s1..s6>
channel <path-a> -> <path-b> delay=<real> weight=<real> angle=<real> lines=<i,j> [plastic]
guard <name> crossing <i>
flow <real>
commit <name>
end
```

Interpretation:

- declare a field;
- declare boundary modules;
- declare delayed, angular, optionally projected channels;
- declare event triggers;
- advance continuous flow;
- perform guarded commits.

This is enough to express a small reactive dynamical program without appealing to Python syntax as the language definition.

## Acceptance Witnesses In Engineering Terms

The `system.cdc` native capability witnesses cover:

| Group | Engineering claim |
| --- | --- |
| A | primitives instantiate, host-free spec exists, self-interference and nesting work |
| B | continuous flow, hybrid evented commits, off-grid events, multirate nesting, continuous delays |
| C | nested fields, scale-relative coupling, multiple reference frames, bounded recursion |
| D | emergent coherence, free-energy guarded commits, predictive belief tracking, action/perception split |
| E | evented state machines, Minsky-counter computation, neural-style dynamics, native syntax |
| F | Gate/interfere/Core-fold, scale-gated operators, multiscale coherence under load |
| G | balanced-ternary trace/window measurement, causal observer windows, projected boundaries |

Local run result for v0.2.2:

```text
1/1 Python bootloader file
150/150 native .cdc expectations
13/13 invariant declarations
25/25 capability declarations
142/142 native witness declarations
operational bridge runtime: lookup/projection/codebook/grid checks pass
```

The witnesses are native contract witnesses. They prove coverage of the listed
claims in the source tree. They do not prove industrial performance, scaling
limits, numeric accuracy, or optimality.

## Strong Claims, Clean Version

### Computational Universality

> The substrate can express universal computation by configuring instruction modules and counters whose guarded commits implement increment and conditional decrement. The native witness suite records this with a two-counter construction.

Boundary: this establishes expressivity, not automatic superiority over every existing computational runtime.

### Neural Substrate

> The substrate can express continuous recurrent dynamics, predictive belief updates, active correction, local Hebbian plasticity, and nested multiscale feedback. These are core ingredients of neural computation.

Boundary: this establishes native support for core neural-computation motifs, not state-of-the-art training efficiency or a full biological brain model.

### Backend Runtime

> The substrate can express state machines, reactive guards, dataflow, delayed signals, adaptive weights, nested processes, and discrete commits in one model.

Boundary: this establishes a unified backend logic model, not an assertion that every production workload should use this runtime.

### Free-Energy Monotonicity

> The belief flow descends local prediction error, and guarded commits reject transitions that increase the local free-energy objective. Global monotonic descent requires additional assumptions about coupling symmetry, delay, and gain.

## Why This Is A Universal Tool

The calculus is useful wherever a system needs the following simultaneously:

- a continuous state;
- a discrete committed state;
- delayed influence;
- local boundaries;
- gated exchange;
- belief/prior mismatch;
- evented commits;
- nested scale;
- multi-agent or multi-module coherence.

Typical software splits these across multiple systems:

- physics/simulation engine;
- event bus;
- state machine;
- reactive UI runtime;
- neural model;
- workflow orchestrator;
- policy engine;
- database state;
- distributed consensus layer.

The calculus provides a common substrate vocabulary for all of them.

## Likely Application Areas

### Agent Orchestration

Use boundary modules as agents or agent states. Use channels for dependency, communication, and delayed evidence. Use commits for guarded handoffs or irreversible state changes.

### Mixed-Reality / Impressions-Style World Models

Use nested fields for reference frames. Use `bidi-gamma-delta` for map/traversal/embodied coherence. Use gates for visibility, consent, maturity, confidence, and privacy.

### Social Field Simulation

Use phase coherence and interference to model group convergence, conflict, resonance, cancellation, and place solidity without exposing raw individuals.

### Policy And Consent Systems

Use the nonnegative balance invariant and free-energy rejection as patterns for "no unsafe commit" behavior.

### Adaptive UI State

Use the continuous/discrete split for interfaces that need fluid state while preserving auditable commits.

### Research / Modeling

Use the system as a small formal lab for active inference, multiscale dynamical systems, and discrete-continuous hybrid computation.

## Interoperation With Adjacent Substrates

The calculus can interoperate with adjacent substrate layers:

- WEFT: boundary / state / transition calculus.
- GIST: evidence / reasoning / proof lattice.
- BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus: continuous-time boundary dynamics, evented commit, nested coherence, and bidirectional coherence-delta coupling.

Possible future integration:

```text
BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus generates and evolves candidate states.
WEFT constrains admissible boundary transitions.
GIST records evidence, counterfactuals, contradiction clusters, and proof packets.
```

That is an integration hypothesis, not a merge instruction.

## Abstract

BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus is a native `.cdc` language with a formal kernel
for hybrid systems that must behave continuously and commit discretely. It
models computation as nested boundary modules made of phase-state cells,
connected by delayed weighted channels that can rotate phase, project onto
selected target dimensions, and cross nested paths. The field evolves through
continuous dynamics, while event-triggered commits quantize state into
balanced-ternary outcomes, enforce invariants, update belief, and reject
incoherent transitions. Its derived trace/window layer lets any module, relation,
or projected boundary serve as observer or measurement participant without
adding a binary observer primitive. The result is a compact language for
simulations, agents, adaptive UI, policy gates, predictive control, social
fields, and mixed-reality world models.

## Minimal Engineer Handoff

If you are implementing or reviewing BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus, preserve these invariants:

1. A phase cell has continuous phase plus latched committed pole.
2. Runtime balanced-ternary value is derived from phase by deadband quantization.
3. Boundary openness gates influence.
4. Channels are directed, weighted, continuously delayed, optionally angle-biased, and optionally projected onto target lines.
5. A boundary module owns input/output cones, belief, prior, precision, and optional child field.
6. Continuous flow updates phase, amplitude, belief, and plastic weights.
7. Guards fire evented commits off-grid.
8. A commit enforces the nonnegative balance invariant.
9. A commit is rejected if it increases local free energy.
10. Nested fields exchange context downward and coherence/evidence upward through `bidi-gamma-delta`; this is the `alpha=0` case of the general path relation.
11. Operators `gate`, `interfere`, and `corefold` remain primitive operations over boundary state.
12. Observer windows and measurement records are derived; they preserve the balanced-ternary `-1 / 0 / +1` outcome space.
13. Trace order is local to a bounded window; smooth phase-time and event-time are not collapsed into a universal tick.
14. The native notation must be able to declare kernel contracts, modules, channels, guards, flow, and commits.
15. Capability claims should be backed by small witness programs.
16. Performance and scaling claims require separate benchmarks.

## Canonical Naming

Use:

- BiDi Coherence-Delta Calculus as the system/calculus name.
- `bidi-gamma-delta` / `bidiγΔ` as the preserved formal concept.
- cell, channel, module, field, and commit as the canonical formal vocabulary.

Use in engineering docs:

- phase cell;
- delayed angular coupling channel;
- boundary module;
- coupled process field;
- evented commit;
- bidirectional coherence-delta coupling.

This keeps the long-lived coherence-delta concept intact while giving the system a clean technical surface for engineers, researchers, and product builders.
