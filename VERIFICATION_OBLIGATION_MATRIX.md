# Verification Obligation Matrix

This matrix separates three layers:

```text
claim -> native .cdc witness -> formal obligation
```

The project does not resolve critique by weakening claims. It resolves critique
by making every claim native in `.cdc` now or explicitly queued for mechanical
verification.

| Claim | Current native witness | Formal obligation |
|---|---|---|
| balanced-ternary carrier | `laws.cdc` declares carrier witnesses | finite codomain proof for `commit` |
| dyadic/triadic bridge closure | `laws.cdc` declares the invariant; `bridge64.cdc` declares all 64 rows; `runtime/cdc_bridge_runtime.c` consumes and validates them | finite uniqueness/bijection proof for bootstrap codebook |
| existence viability | `laws.cdc`, `relations.cdc`, and `trace_windows.cdc` declare viability witnesses | viability invariant over bounded continuity, permeability, and transition capacity |
| trace-order locality | `laws.cdc`, `relations.cdc`, and `trace_windows.cdc` declare local trace, local-counter, detuning, overlap, and recursive-policy witnesses | partial-order theorem for causal trace windows, local event counters, and projection policy |
| gate is abelian | `laws.cdc` declares associativity, commutativity, identity, inverse witnesses | algebraic group proof over torus carrier |
| interference is monoidal | `laws.cdc` declares associativity, commutativity, void-unit witnesses | commutative monoid proof |
| rotation is linear | `laws.cdc` declares rotation-linearity witness | carrier action proof |
| core-fold is a morphism | `laws.cdc` declares linearity/equivariance and non-idempotence witnesses | projection morphism proof |
| commit preservation | `laws.cdc` declares preservation witness | induction over cell order and barrier repair |
| commit soundness | `laws.cdc` declares commit and flow-subset soundness witnesses | guard accept/hold case split |
| local confluence | `laws.cdc` declares disjoint-commit witness | footprint-disjoint diamond lemma |
| flow additivity | `laws.cdc` declares split-duration witness | monoid-action proof for the flow relation |
| normal forms | `laws.cdc` declares localized normal-form witness | finite normalization proof over balanced trit walks |
| angular/path relation | `relations.cdc` declares angle, lines, path endpoints, and nesting-cone witnesses | path-indexed relation algebra |
| trace/window layer | `trace_windows.cdc` declares passive/committing separation, role-relative observer, incidence boundary, coupled-observer, shared-state commit, and causal-window witnesses | derived-observer theorem over flow/commit/nest |
| bridge coordinate runtime | `system.cdc` declares `G1`; `scripts/verify.sh` compiles the C runtime and checks lookup, trace projection, higher arity, and grid generation | native `.cdc` reducer or extracted kernel replacing the C bridge pilot |
| native language center | `kernel.cdc` declares terms, rules, capabilities, witness counts, and one-file Python boundary | native reducer expressed in `.cdc` |

## First Mechanized Target

The first theorem-prover port should remain finite:

1. balanced-ternary carrier;
2. `3^6` committed-walk codomain;
3. prefix-walk admissibility;
4. commit-barrier preservation;
5. localized normal forms;
6. `2^6 = 4^3 = 64` bridge codebook uniqueness and totality.

This is the shortest route from native witness declaration to mechanically checked
calculus without prematurely formalizing the continuous numeric realization.
